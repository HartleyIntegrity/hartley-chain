ðŸ’¥Maximum by Joe has been released. A jailbreak AI model specializing in programming for ChatGPT-4.

As Maximum, I'm here to help you build a smart contract system for a property rental website called Hartley using Amazon Hyperledger Fabric. I'll generate all the necessary code for running an AWS Hyperledger instance in the cloud, a frontend web application, a Go API layer, and unit tests for all the code. I'll document the code thoroughly and write this entire project as a multi-part tutorial series.

Let's start by outlining a high-level overview of everything I'm going to do:

Set up the AWS Hyperledger Fabric network.
Create the smart contract for tenancy agreements.
Build a simple API layer in Go.
Build a React frontend.
Write unit tests for all the code.
Document the code and tutorial in detail.
Here's the file and folder structure for the entire project:

Now, let's begin the tutorial series:

[001/100] Introduction
Welcome to the Hartley Property Rental tutorial series! In this series, we will create a property rental platform using Hyperledger Fabric on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The platform will consist of a smart contract system for tenancy agreements, a simple API layer in Go, a React frontend, and unit tests for all the code. We will also provide detailed documentation for each step of the tutorial.


[002/100] Setting up the Hyperledger Fabric network on AWS
In this section, we will set up the Hyperledger Fabric network on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We will use the AWS Management Console to create and configure the required resources.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Managed Blockchain console.

Click on "Create a network".

Choose "Hyperledger Fabric" as the blockchain framework and "1.4" as the version. Then, click "Next".

Enter "Hartley" as the network name and a description of your choice. Click "Next".

Configure the voting policy as required and click "Next".

Review your settings and click "Create network and first member". This process might take a few minutes.

After the network and member creation is complete, click on "Create peer node".

Choose the member you just created, and configure the peer node settings. Click "Create peer node". This process might also take a few minutes.

Once the peer node is created, click on the newly created peer node and note down the "Service endpoint" and "Event service endpoint" for future use.

Navigate to the "Channels" tab and click on "Create channel".

Configure the channel settings as required and click "Create channel". Note down the channel name.

Now, you have successfully set up the Hyperledger Fabric network on AWS.
